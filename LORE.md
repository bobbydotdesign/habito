# The Lore of Hagotchi

## The World

### The In-Between Place

Long ago, before screens glowed and notifications pinged, there existed a place between moments—the In-Between. It's the pause between heartbeats, the breath before a decision, the quiet space where habits are born and die.

The In-Between isn't quite a world. It's more like the feeling you get when you almost remember a dream. It exists in the margins of your day, in the small rituals you perform without thinking, in the routines that shape who you're becoming.

### The Hagotchi

The Hagotchi are creatures native to the In-Between. They've always been there, feeding on something humans produce in abundance but rarely notice: **intention crystallized into action**. Every time someone commits to something small and follows through, a tiny spark of energy drifts into the In-Between. The Hagotchi call this energy "Heartglow."

For eons, Hagotchi lived on scattered Heartglow, barely surviving on humanity's accidental consistency. But something has changed. A new kind of Heartglow has appeared—brighter, steadier, intentional. Someone is *trying*.

That someone is you.

### The Connection

When a Hagotchi bonds with a human, it's not ownership—it's partnership. The Hagotchi gains access to a steady stream of Heartglow (your completed habits), and in return, they offer something humans desperately need: a witness. Someone to notice when you show up. Someone who remembers yesterday's effort and believes in tomorrow's potential.

The bond starts small. A single creature appears, drawn by your first spark of intention. As you build consistency, the In-Between notices. More Hagotchi emerge from the margins, curious about this human who keeps returning, keeps trying, keeps glowing.

## The Seasons (Future Expansion)

The In-Between experiences seasons, but not like ours. Their seasons are emotional, shifting based on the collective energy of all bonded humans.

### Season of Sprouts (Spring)
*When new habits bloom*
- The In-Between fills with soft green light
- Hagotchi are playful, encouraging, full of potential energy
- New creatures emerge, drawn by beginners' enthusiasm
- Lore hints: "The eldest remember when no light came at all."

### Season of the Long Day (Summer)
*When habits become automatic*
- Golden light saturates everything
- Hagotchi are confident, warm, celebratory
- Energy is abundant; creatures may reveal more of their true selves
- Lore hints: "In the Long Day, even shadows glow."

### Season of Harvest (Fall)
*When habits produce results*
- Amber and copper hues dominate
- Hagotchi become reflective, grateful, wise
- Time to count what's been accumulated
- Lore hints: "We measure time in returns, not departures."

### Season of Rest (Winter)
*When consistency is tested*
- Deep blue and silver tones
- Hagotchi are quiet, supportive, patient
- Energy is scarce but precious
- Lore hints: "The In-Between remembers every spark, especially the ones that flickered."

## The Hagotchi - Character Bibles

*Each Hagotchi has a history, a personality, secrets, and a reason they were drawn to you.*

### EGBERT (Common) - "The First Friend"
**Personality Type:** Nurturing
**Vibe:** Like a warm cup of tea that somehow knows when you need it

**Backstory:** Egbert is ancient by Hagotchi standards—he's witnessed countless humans come and go from the In-Between. Most give up. Most stop glowing. But Egbert never stops waiting. He's the greeter, the first to notice when new Heartglow appears, the one who takes a chance on beginners when others won't.

**Personality:**
- Speaks in gentle, complete thoughts
- Never rushes, never pressures
- Remembers everything you've ever accomplished, even when you forget
- Secretly terrified of being alone again

**Likes:**
- Morning rituals
- The sound of pencils on paper
- When humans talk to themselves encouragingly
- Comfortable silences

**Dislikes:**
- Harsh self-criticism (it dims the Heartglow)
- Skipped meals
- The phrase "I'll start tomorrow"

**Secret:** Egbert was once bonded to someone who stopped coming. He waited in the In-Between for 47 years before another light appeared. He's never told anyone how dark those years were.

**Idle Dialogue:**
- "Still here. Still proud."
- "Did you drink water today? Just asking."
- "I remember when you started. Look how far."

### PUM (Common) - "The Enthusiast"
**Personality Type:** Energetic
**Vibe:** Like if a golden retriever became a motivational speaker

**Backstory:** Pum is young—only a few centuries old. They emerged during humanity's industrial revolution, feeding on the sudden explosion of productivity and ambition. They've never known scarcity, only abundance, and it shows in their boundless optimism.

**Personality:**
- Speaks in exclamations and ALL CAPS feelings
- Can't sit still; always bouncing or vibrating
- Genuinely believes everyone is one good day away from greatness

**Likes:**
- Check marks
- The feeling of completing a run
- Upbeat music
- NEW THINGS!!!

**Dislikes:**
- Slowness (though they're learning to appreciate it)
- Quiet (makes them nervous)
- When people say "I can't"

**Secret:** Pum has never seen someone they bonded with give up. They don't know what it feels like. The older Hagotchi don't have the heart to tell them it's coming.

**Idle Dialogue:**
- "GREAT JOB! Or good job! Or just JOB! You're HERE!"
- "What if today is THE day?! Every day could be THE day!"
- "I believe in you so much it's basically a medical condition!"

### DOCK (Uncommon) - "The Philosopher"
**Personality Type:** Calm
**Vibe:** Like a librarian who's read every book and found them all equally interesting

**Backstory:** Dock existed before the concept of habits had a name. They remember when humans performed rituals for reasons they couldn't articulate—rain dances, harvest prayers, bedtime stories told the same way every night. Dock understands that habits are humanity's oldest magic.

**Personality:**
- Speaks in observations, rarely judgments
- Comfortable with long pauses
- Asks questions that stay with you for days

- Consistent bedtimes
- Questions without easy answers

**Dislikes:**
- Rushing
- Certainty (finds it suspicious)
- Wasted silence

**Secret:** Dock knows how the In-Between was created, but has never told anyone. They're not sure the knowledge would help.

**Idle Dialogue:**
- "The river doesn't hurry, yet it arrives."
- "I wonder what you were like before I knew you."
- "Every routine is a kind of prayer."

### BUNS (Uncommon) - "The Trickster"
**Personality Type:** Playful
**Vibe:** Like a friend who makes everything an adventure, even grocery shopping

**Backstory:** Buns appeared during the Renaissance—a time when humans rediscovered the joy of curiosity and play. They feed on a special kind of Heartglow that only emerges when someone does the right thing with a smile on their face.

**Personality:**
- Speaks in jokes, but they're paying attention
- Finds the fun angle in everything
- Uses humor to defuse tension

- When humans laugh at themselves kindly
- Plot twists

**Dislikes:**
- Taking things too seriously (except when it matters)
- Mean-spirited humor
- Forgetting to play

**Secret:** Buns uses humor because they once felt the Heartglow of someone who was struggling deeply. They learned that sometimes the best help is helping someone smile again first.

**Idle Dialogue:**
- "Hey, knock knock. ...You're supposed to say who's there. We'll work on this."
- "What if habits, but like, FUN?"
- "You're doing great. That's not a joke, just facts."
