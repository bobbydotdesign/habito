# Hagotchi Product Document

## Vision
A habit tracker that feels alive. Your Hagotchi companion grows with you, celebrating your consistency and making habit-building feel like nurturing a friendship rather than checking boxes.

---

## Product Principles

### 1. Positive Reinforcement Only
- No punishment for missed days, no guilt mechanics
- Hearts never decay - progress is always forward
- Celebrate streaks without shaming breaks

### 2. Delightful Simplicity
- The heart IS the progress bar - no redundant UI
- One glance tells you everything you need to know
- Terminal aesthetic: clean, focused, no visual clutter

### 3. Emotional Connection
- Hagotchis have personalities and speak to you
- Unlocking new companions feels like meeting new friends
- Per-Hagotchi stats create a journal of your journey together

### 4. Respect User's Time
- Fast load, instant feedback
- No ads, no dark patterns, no engagement tricks
- The app serves you, not the other way around
